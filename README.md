# Wine Quality Prediction Utilizing Machine Learning

## Overview

This projects focus is to create a user friendly way to use machine learning and predict wine qualities based on physiochemical inputs.

To do this I used [this data set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) to train a machine learning model. Given the data set, I chose supervised learning and found that the **Random Forest Classifier** resulted in the most accuracy of **88.54%**
